## Project Requirements and Deliverables

### 1. Application Prototype

- **Fully Functional Prototype**  
  - Create a fully functional Android mobile application prototype conforming to the requirement specifications.

- **Core Functionalities**  
  - Implement a minimum of three major functionalities tailored to the selected scenario.  
    - Example: *Health Management App*:  
      - Patient registration  
      - Appointment scheduling  
      - Staff registration  

- **Authentication**  
  - Include secure login and signup functionality.

- **User Interface (UI)**  
  - Design intuitive, user-friendly interfaces with responsive layouts that adapt to various screen sizes.

- **Database Connectivity**  
  - Implement proper database connectivity (e.g., SQLite, Firebase) with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

- **Architecture Pattern**  
  - Structure the application using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.

- **Error Handling and Input Validation**  
  - Use proper error handling, input validations, and appropriate navigation techniques.

- **Code Quality**  
  - Write consistent and readable code with comments explaining the purpose and logic behind key functions.

- **Third-Party Libraries**  
  - If using third-party libraries, demonstrate their usage and explain the purpose of each library in the code.

- **APK Generation**  
  - Generate an APK file to demonstrate a working version of the application on an Android device or emulator.
